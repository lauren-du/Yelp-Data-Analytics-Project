# Yelp-Data-Analytics-Project



This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive Yelp dataset to generate insights that inform customer-oriented strategies. It addresses three key business questions using machine learning, natural language processing, and statistical modeling.

Objectives:
	1.	Customer Segmentation: Identify user segments based on their reviews and propose tailored marketing strategies.
	2.	Ratings Prediction: Predict customer ratings for businesses and identify key influencers of customer impressions.
	3.	Business Recommendation: Recommend business categories based on customer profiles to enhance personalization.

Dataset:

The dataset is a subset of Yelp’s vast data repository, encompassing:
	•	Businesses: 29,527 entries with attributes such as location, ratings, and amenities.
	•	Users: 45,019 profiles with metadata like reviews, votes, and compliments.
	•	Reviews: 50,000 customer reviews with star ratings and text.
